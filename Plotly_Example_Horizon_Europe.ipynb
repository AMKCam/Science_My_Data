    "Hello! This workbook is intended to teach you how to use plotly. It is not an extensive guide, rather it aims to teach you how to make basic and beautiful plots with whatever data you have at hand. We use the data from the United Kingdom Research Institute (UKRI) which can be found here: https://gtr.ukri.org/. I have filtered active projects funded by the Horizon Europe Guarantee and downloaded the result as a csv. For those new to Plotly, an extensive online guide is available: https://plotly.com/. Let's get started!"
